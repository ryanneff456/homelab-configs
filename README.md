# Homelab & Systems Portfolio
This repository showcases my hands-on experience configuring Linux systems, virutal machines, and server environments.

## Overview
I built and configured multiple systems as part of my homelab to strengthen my skills in installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and server management.  
This repo documents those setups, along with notes, configuration files, and lessons learned.

## Projects

|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Kali Linux VM](./kali-vm-setup)               | VirtualBox, Kali Linux      | Configured VM for penetration testing with custom networking                        |
| [Arch Linux VM](./arch-vm-setup)               | Arch Linux, Pacman, systemd | Minimal install, package configuration, and desktop setup                           |
| [Raspberry Pi Server](./raspberry-pi-server)   | Raspberry Pi OS, Docker     | Home server with Pi-hole, WireGuard VPN, and Grafana/Prometheus scraping            |
| [Arch on 2012 MacBook](./macbook-arch-install) | Arch Linux, Hyprland        | Optimized lightweight Linux for legacy hardware                                     |

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Operating System Installation**: Windows, Kali Linux, Arch Linux, Raspberry Pi OS
- **System Configuration**: Networking, package management, BIOS/UEFI tuning
- **Server Management**: Docker, containerized applications  Nextcloud, Jellyfin)
- **Networking & Security**: Configured WireGuard VPN for secure remote access
- **Monitoring & Visualization**: Set up Grafana dashboards to track system performance
- **Remote Administration**: Managed servers via SSH with key-based authentication
- **Troubleshooting**: Hardware compatibility, driver issues, and DNS conflicts
- **Automation & Scripting**: Bash scripting for setup and configuration tasks

## Why This Matters
These projects demonstrate my ability to learn quickly, solve problems, and adapt technology to different environments.  
They represent the same skills I would bring to an IT/Systems role: practical configuration, troubleshooting, and reliable results.
